Thanks to Ramiris’s mind-boggling powers, Tempest’s entire capital-buildings, inhabitants, and all-has been evacuated into the nation’s labyrinthine Dungeon. While Primal Demons Testarossa and Ultima kick some serious imperial butt over on the front lines, the rest of the Empire’s army attempts to storm the Dungeon. Little does the enemy know, however, that they’re about to face a devastating bloodbath at the hands of Tempest’s own mighty forces…

With their apartment complex in ruins, he and his neighbor must now find new places to live. And as if that isn’t stressful enough, a riot breaks out right next to Miss Hoshizaki’s condo, so of course Sasaki and Futarishizuka come to the rescue…in disguise?! Meanwhile, in the otherworld, the succession dispute takes a drastic turn when Prince Lewis launches an offensive against the Ohgen Empire, forcing Sasaki and Peeps to go undercover to save Herz. When exactly are they supposed to relax again?

But his work is interrupted when, surrounded by 30 miles of refuse, the ship and its high-tech systems are plagued by a series of strange malfunctions and the crew is battered by a raging storm.
                                                                                                    <br><br>

Even worse, the ship has been sabotaged, two crewmen are dead, and a third is missing. Hawkins spots signs of the missing man onshore and leads a small team to bring him back. But they quickly discover evidence of a brutal history left behind by the island’s former occupants: Unit 731, Japan’s ruthless World War II human experimentation program. Mass graves and military fortifications dot the island, along with a decades-old laboratory housing the remains of hideous experiments.

A week into his stay, strange red flakes descend from the surface. Scores of fish are dead and dying, poisoned by the debris that turns to powder in Miller’s fingers and tastes like blood.
